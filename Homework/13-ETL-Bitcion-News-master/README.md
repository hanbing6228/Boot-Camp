# ETL-Bitcion-News
Created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is the world’s first cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency in which transactions are verified using cryptography and recorded on a public digital ledger known as a blockchain. In recent years Bitcoin has gained widespread media attention for its exponential growth. It has been acclaimed as the future of currency. It has also been criticized as this century’s greatest bubble. Cryptocurrency’s rise in popularity (or notoriety), have also led to an increase in frequency of article publications on the subject. Our question of interest is if these articles affect market participation and price of Bitcoin. To answer this question we obtained the daily price, volume, and google trend for Bitcoin from 2014. We then took relevant articles published by the New York Times and calculated the sentiment using a natural language processing library and compared the sentiment with the quoted data. Our results were then loaded onto MongoDB.
